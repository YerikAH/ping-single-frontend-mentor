This is a solution to the ping-single-column. The challenge is from [Front-end Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/ping-single-column-coming-soon-page-fuhD2JG09c).


## Challenge consists of

1. View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
1. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
1. Submit their email address using an input field
1. Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
- The input field is empty
- The email address is not formatted correctly


## What I learned
Another challenge completed, development was easy, although I think I could have developed it better, just using the "useState hook".
I created this little app to beef up React a bit, I don't develop much with React right now :( .

## Technologies used in the project
- React
- CSS
- styled-components
- TypeScript
- Vite
